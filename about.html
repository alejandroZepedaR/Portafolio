                    Hello, I'm Alejandro Zepeda, a dedicated Computer Science Junior hailing from Mexico.
                    I have garnered hands-on experience in building robust websites, intuitive mobile applications,
                    and practical software tools that aim to solve real-world problems. Through my work, I'm continuously
                    seeking to blend creativity with technical prowess to deliver exceptional digital solutions.

                <p>
                    I am currently pursuing my Computer Science degree at the
                    University of Arizona, where I'm honing my technical skills
                    and expanding my knowledge in various computing technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prior to this, I successfully completed an Associate's Degree in
                    System Analysis and Programming from Pima Community College. This
                    helped me establish a strong foundation in the discipline, providing
                    me with an understanding of both theoretical principles and practical
                    applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result, I'm adept at analyzing systems and creating efficient
                    programs, always striving for innovation and excellence in my academic
                    and professional pursuits.

                    In addition to my academic pursuits,
                    I've also cultivated a range of practical
                    skills through my part-time role as a Keyholder
                    Manager at ASICS, a multinational sportswear corporation.
                    Over the past three years, I've had the opportunity to hone
                    my ability to work within a team, manage organizational tasks,
                    and deliver exceptional customer service.

                    My role at ASICS has taught me the importance of

                    worked closely with diverse teams to achieve our 
                    collective goals. I've learned the art of customer 
                    service, which has instilled in me a deep understanding
                    of user needsâ€”a perspective that's immensely valuable
                    when designing and developing tech solutions.
                    Additionally, juggling various responsibilities has
                    improved my organizational skills, allowing me to effectively
                    manage tasks, meet deadlines, and maintain high standards of work.

                    to a hand sanitizer factory, each role has taught me invaluable lessons about diligence, resilience, and the value of hard work. My

                    Within the first week, I had absorbed detailed information about every shoe technology we sold - a testament to
                    my adaptability and thirst for knowledge. Recognizing my reliability and potential, I was promoted to the role of
                    Keyholder within the first month.
